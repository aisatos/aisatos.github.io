### Hi There!

My name is Ana and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina, currently living in Berlin.

I am a passionate, creative software engineer specializing in Java Backend. The idea here is to create a blog with the key items I'm learning about while improving as a developer. Hopefully someone else can also use this to help clarify some concepts.
